# Safety .gitignore for /config/smartbedmqtt_src
#
# Why:
# - Prevent committing Home Assistant secrets or runtime state if this repo is ever
#   initialized inside /config.
# - The shell_command publishes via `git add .`, so this must be conservative.
#
# How:
# - Ignore common HA sensitive/runtime files and folders.
